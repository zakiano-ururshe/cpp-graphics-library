# cpp-graphics-library
A library for creating graphics in C++
In this structure, we have a clear separation between the different components of the project: the source code for the graphics library, the header files for the various shapes, lines, points, and colors, example code that demonstrates how to use the library, and a set of tests to verify that everything works as expected.

The Include folder is organized as a C++ namespace (graphics) and contains all the header files for the library. Each header file is named after the C++ class it defines (shape.h, rectangle.h, circle.h, line.h, point.h, and color.h). Additionally, each header file has a corresponding .cpp file in the src folder, where the implementation of the class is defined.
